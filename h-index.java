Description:
	Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a 
	researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

	According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index
	h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other 
	N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

For example:
	given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers 
	in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
	Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the 
	remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

Note: 
	If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the 
	h-index.
